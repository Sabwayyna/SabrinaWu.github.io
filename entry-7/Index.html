            This digital painting portrays the emotional complexities many people are facing amid the ongoing pandemic. 
            It depicts a mix of feelings—despair and isolation, but also hints of hope and optimism.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The artwork centers around interlocked hands, representing both the struggles and the unity experienced collectively during these challenging times. 
            It aims to resonate with those going through similar experiences, showcasing the intertwined feelings of despair and hope that coexist in our current reality.
            The intertwining hands symbolize the shared human experiences and the solidarity felt universally. 
            By juxtaposing despair with hope, the artwork captures the nuanced emotions people are navigating in the midst of change caused by the pandemic.

    <p>I aim to explore a more traditional painting technique in the medium of digital painting, 
        utilizing an underpainting method as the foundation, which I then layered upon to create a more visually dimensional environment for the depiction of hands.
        By employing a diverse range of intricate and vibrant colors to construct the hands, my objective was to convey the intricate emotional spectrum experienced by individuals during this unparalleled period. 
        The intention was to encapsulate the complexity, confusion, and emotional depth felt by people amidst the uncertain times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Embracing abstraction as a significant design element, 
             I incorporated it to integrate the hands as the central subject in my interpretation of the pandemic. 
        This allowed the hands to serve as a representation of my perspective during this period of crisis.
    </p>
        In the final stages of my painting process, I delicately layered thin white lines to evoke a sense of displacement and separation

        The onset of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html">COVID-19 pandemic</a> in February 2020 brought an unprecedented and unexpected wave of change, altering life as I knew it. 
        This change felt overwhelming, just like it did for many others. 
        It was a time of worry and confusion, as everything we knew shifted so suddenly. 
        Uncertainty and anxiety became constants as familiar routines and plans swiftly changed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In response to this turbulent period, I created a painting using hands as symbols to capture the collective experience. 
    </p>

    <p>The interlocked hands in the artwork reflect the struggle and confusion that was pervasive. 
        They represent the attempt to connect in a time where everything seemed to slip away, portraying the difficulties we all faced in comprehending and adapting to this swift and unexpected change.</p>

    <p>
        Amidst this chaos, my intention with this painting was to honor and acknowledge those who faced even greater hardships during that challenging time. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The artwork stands as a tribute to individuals who bore heavier burdens, signifying solidarity and support for those who were enduring more significant struggles. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It's a visual recognition of the difficulties faced by others during the commencement and height of the pandemic.
